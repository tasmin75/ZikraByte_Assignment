# Nourished Kids Meal Landing Page 

A beautiful animated landing page for a kids' meal delivery service. Built with love for the Zikrabyte assessment.

## 🎯 What This Is

A single-page website that's fun to look at and easy to use. It shows off a meal service for kids with smooth animations and works great on phones and computers.

## 📋 Features

## 🛠️ What I Used

- **React** - For building the interface
- **TypeScript** - For cleaner code
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling
- **Framer Motion** - For smooth animations
- **React Router** - For navigation
- **Vite** - For fast development

## 📂 How I Organized Everything

```
src/
├── assets/           # All images
├── components/       # Reusable pieces
│   └── landingPage/  # Page sections
├── pages/            # Main pages
├── lib/              # Helper functions
└── App.tsx           # Main app file
```

Simple and clean. Easy to find anything.

## 🎨 Design Notes

I followed the Figma design closely but added my own touch with animations. Every section has smooth transitions, and the site feels alive. Mobile users get the same great experience as desktop users.

- Creating smooth animations
- Making responsive layouts
- Writing cleaner code
- Building reusable components

A custom button with a cool sliding animation. Took time to get it right, but it looks amazing!

The vegetables in the hero section follow your mouse. It's subtle but adds a fun touch.

Testimonials rotate smoothly without any buttons. Clean and simple.
